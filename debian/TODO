In this file we collect all upcomming tasks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Support NFLOG target and provide a function to end a chain including logging
  and a final DROP or REJECT. [DONE]
* Implement a ruleset rollback if the user is not able to respond anymore after
  a new ruleset was applied.
* Exit if there is an error during config and library load
* Place the manpage in the packet [DONE]
* Implement functions to search for objects already defined and something like "Show where its used"
* register_host currently supports three types of objects:
  + "single" (host)
  + "list" (of hosts)
  + "netlist" (list of nets)
  register_net not even supports different types of objects.
  Why not add a fourth type "net"? Or move "netlist" to register_net function? Thats confusing!
* Update manpage (date and version)
* Remove obsolete variable $LOGLEVEL
